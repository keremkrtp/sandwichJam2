**Developed for Sandwich Jam 2 Game Jam 2025**

## 🕵️‍♂️ Overview
[still-no-name] is a psychological noir thriller and puzzle-exploration game. You play as a detective trapped within the shifting confines of a crime scene. As your sanity slips, the very walls around you betray your senses—rooms expand, hallways stretch, and the exit vanishes. To uncover the truth behind the murder, you must piece together fragmented memories while fighting to maintain control over your own mind.

## 🌀 Theme: Losing Control
The "Losing Control" theme is integrated into both the narrative and the core mechanics:
* **Shifting Reality:** As the sanity meter drops, the house transitions from a small cabin into a non-Euclidean labyrinth.
* **Control Degradation:** High insanity levels cause stochastic input interference, making the character harder to steer.
* **Psychotic Parkour:** Surreal obstacles manifest as the detective's mental state worsens, forcing players to navigate through floating furniture and distorted architecture.

## 🛠️ Key Features
* **Memory Puzzle System:** Collect and assemble photo fragments on a dedicated "Puzzle Table" to unlock new areas and flashbacks.
* **Dynamic Environment:** Experience a house that grows and changes based on your progression and mental state.
* **Adaptive Noir Atmosphere:** A procedural soundscape created in Ableton Live that shifts from clean noir jazz to distorted chaos as sanity depletes.
* **Environmental Storytelling:** Uncover the mystery through item interactions and visual cues in a rain-soaked, atmospheric setting.
